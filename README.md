## About

This repo contains a full stack demo website for an imaginary used computer selling website. This project demonstrates a solution written with the following technologies:

- The backed server:
  - Written in JavaScript
  - Using middleware and routing from Express
  - HTTP rest tests
  - Authentication and XSS protection

- The frontend:
  - Written in JavaScript with the Svlete framework
  - Using middleware, Svelte stores and routing from page.js
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
  
The project was written and edited in JetBrains, so this project contains a `.idea` folder for the project settings. This IDE was used to run `.rest` HTTP rest test files for the backend.
